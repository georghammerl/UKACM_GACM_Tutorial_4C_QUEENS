# Introduction to 4C Multiphysics

4C is a parallel multiphysics research code to analyze and solve a plethora of physical problems
described by ordinary or partial differential equations. Its development is driven by challenging research questions and real-world problems, for which existing tools do not suffice, either due to the lack of capabilities or due to falling short of accuracy or performance. 4C offers ready-to-use simulation
capabilities for a variety of physical models, encompassing single-field systems such as solids, fluids, and scalar transport phenomena, as well as coupled multiphysics systems. Its modular architecture
also supports research in mathematical modeling and the development of novel numerical methods.
